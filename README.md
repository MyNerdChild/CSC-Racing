Using Object Oriented Design methodologies, write a program that simulates a car racing game.

Game: 
The user will race against the CPU on a given track.  The race will consist of a user car and 2 CPU cars.  Each car will move during their turn in any order you decide.  The first of the 3 cars to reach the finish line wins.

Track:
A track will consist of the following space types:
- Open Spaces - blank spaces or ' '
- Wall Spaces - labeled 'x'
- Finish Line - labeled 'F'
